# Klickkit is an Enterprise which is aimed at solving pre-existing problems using AI.

Phantom provides with a dynamic capability to understand unique tasks, which can differ from one organisation to another. Using our NLP engine, users can set reminders and milestones with utmost ease.
Further, with the knowledge obtained, our system can act as a perfect virtual manager by managing the various tasks. It is powerful and unique because of its time tracking feature which will indeed help the system predict the working capacities of various employees based on their task performances. With the help of the time tracking feature, the system can act as a task scheduler to improve the efficiency of the company on the whole by making calculated suggestions on how to improve the organisations throughput.
